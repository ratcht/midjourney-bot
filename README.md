# midjourney-bot
A platform that allows for the interaction with MidJourney programatically

Typically, MidJourney is only accessible through discord messages and does not have a public API. This is an issue for those looking to implement MidJourney in their programming applications.

This tool allows for that to be done. It offers a way to log into discord and complete the captcha. From there, the auth token is obtained and the tool can interact with MidJourney fully programmatically. It automatically upscales images as well.
